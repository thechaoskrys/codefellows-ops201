### Questions from assignment

1. **What is a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), and why is it important for an organization?**
- A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is a procedure specific to a certain company or organization that details what is necessary to complete a particular task. It is important to an organization because it is used to enforce and implement a policy. 

2. **What are the three types of documents that should be included in an SOP manual? Briefly describe each type.**
- Policy: This answers the 'why' for things that need to be done within the SOP. It provides broad guidance.
- Work Instructions: This answers the 'how' things need to be done within the company/organization. It may provide instructions step-by-step to accomplish a task. 

3. **Why are SOPs considered a primary way to implement or enforce policies in an organization?**
- Companies can share their general expectations or provide verbal how-to's for the employees to follow, however, that makes it difficult to uphold the standards of the SOP without grievances from the staff. Goals for the organization are not actionable without SOPs. 

4. **What does the author emphasize regarding the audience when writing SOPs, and why is it essential to consider them?**
- The author places an emphasis on keeping the SOP readable, consumable, understandable, actionable, and measurable.
- It is essential to consider these things to ensure that people are able to read the SOP without issue or difficulty. Also, the content should be easy to read and easy to understand because it is to the point and uses simple terms. It is also important to state clearly what needs to be done and the activities described in the SOP should be specific and measurable.

5. **Imagine you are a part of a multicultural team responsible for following an SOP. How would you address potential misunderstandings or differing interpretations of the procedure due to cultural differences? Propose strategies to foster effective cross-cultural communication.**
- In a multicultural team it is very easy to have miscommunications based on how things are worded in an SOP. I would have each member of the team that wants to share their perspective on their understanding of the policies. Once we have shared our understanding, I hope that everyone would be able to come to a general understanding, but would seek confirmation from a direct supervisor and work my way up the chain of command.

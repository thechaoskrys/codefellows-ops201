# Data Restoration, Startup Repair, and Secure Disposal 

## SolarwindsMSP: SSD Data Recovery Best Practices

### Questions from assignment
1. **What are some common indicators that an SSD may be failing?**
- Bad blocks: saving, moving, and reading files result in failure, or active applications may frequently crash or operate slowly.
- File system repair: When your computer indicates that it requires repair but physical defect software shows no damage, it could be indicating an issue with the connector port. 
- Crashing: When a computer crashes while booting, but works fine after a few reboots, there could be an indication that the SSD is failing. 
- Read-only mode: Some SSD's may only function except in read-only mode. 

2. **How do SSD failures differ from HDD failures in terms of detectability?**
- While HDDs emit audible signals like whirring, clicking, or humming when approaching a complete shutdown, SSDs may operate in silence until they completely stop functioning. 

3. **What are bad blocks in an SSD, and how do they affect its performance?**
- Bad blocks are when memory corruption or physical damage affects the storage segment of the SSD which results in impeding data storage and retrieval functions. 

4. **How can power cycling an SSD help resolve certain issues?**
- Power cycling the SSD is a rest of the device and may resolve the issue of the SSD becoming corrupted through power failure. 

5. **How might this topic be relevant in the aftermath of a natural disaster? Describe how individuals or communities can use these techniques to recover data and resume their normal activities.**
- In any natural disaster, there is a possibility that the SSD for a business/organization faced damages, but is salavageable enough to transfer information or needs to be troubleshooted to resume function (like corruption due to power loss. Knowing this information can be beneficial in 'triaging' the computer's SSD.

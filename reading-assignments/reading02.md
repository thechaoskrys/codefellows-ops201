## What is Bash?

### Questions from Assignment
1. What is the primary function of a shell in a computerâ€™s operating system?
- A shell is used to operate outside of the basic commands of the computer, which allows humans to interact with computers whenever they want. 

2. How does Bash locate and execute commands on a Linux or Unix system?
- Bash can be used to locate and excute commands on a Linux or Unix system because the commands are stored in a default directory that Bash can access to see if the command exists and carry out the task. Most commands are stored in system directories like /usr/bin and /bin. 

3. How can you determine if your system is running a Bash shell?
- To determine if a Bash shell is in use, the echo command can be used, as well as a special variable that represents the current running process. 

4. What makes Bash scripting powerful and why is it considered scriptable?
- Bash scripting is considered powerful because it is scriptable. This means, anything that is input in Bash can be ran by Bash as a plain-text file. This takes away the necessity of manually inputting multiple commands when the commands can be scripted as a list and Bash will excute them. 

5. Bash scripting allows for customization, automation, and efficiency. Discuss methods or practices from your previous work experience or cultural background that aim to achieve similar goals in daily tasks.
- Bash scripting reminds me of Emergency Medical Dispatch protocols. It allows for customization by inputting crucial information to produce a result (the priority of the call), but also has a certain amount of automation and efficiency which will ensure the results are similar and completed in a timely manner.

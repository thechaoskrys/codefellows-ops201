# Malware Remediation Tools and Technique 

## How to remove malware from your Windows PC

### Questios from assignment
1. **What are the main differences between anti-virus and anti-malware software?**
- Anti-virus software is used to remove traditional types of malware known as viruses, while anti-malware software is used to remove other malicious software beyond just viruses, such as, spyware, trojans and ransomware. 

2. **What are some signs or symptoms that may indicate a malware infection on your PC?**
- Slower than usual performance
- sudden pop-ups

3. **Explain the difference between a full system scan and a quick scan when using antimalware software.**
- A full scan searches everything on the computer, while a quick scan only searches vulnerable parts of the computer. A quick scan is designed to be faster and can take 5-20 mins. 

4. **What should you do if your computer is infected with ransomware?**
- Boot the computer into safe mode, remove temporary files, run a scan with a malware scanner (use a different one than what is on the computer, as nothing is 100% acurrate), and attempt to identify the vulnerable area the malware gained access and fix it. 

5. **Compare and contrast malware removal techniques in Windows PCs with those in other operating systems like macOS or Linux. How might these different approaches reflect the cultural values and priorities of the technology users?**
- I believe all the steps are similar, regardless of what OS the user is operating, however, the execution may be a little different. The malware scanners that are available for one OS may not be available for another, and the process of accessing taht OS' safe mode may vary.

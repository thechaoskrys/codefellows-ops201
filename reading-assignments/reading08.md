1. **What is the Windows Registry, and what does it store?**
- Windows Registry is a collection of several databases where Windows and many programs store their configuration settings.

3. **What are “registry hacks” and why might someone want to use them?**
- Since the registry database is so large, 'registry hacks' were created ti help the average user determine what they need to change in the registry to accomplish a certain result.

4. **What are some common tasks you can perform by editing the Windows Registry?**
- Tasks that may be completed by editing the Windows Registry are disbabling the Windows 10 lockscreen, stop other accounts from shutting down the PC, block user accounts from running specific apps, display a message at sign-in, amongst many other things.

5. **Imagine you’re explaining the concept of the Windows Registry to someone who has never used a computer before. How would you make this explanation culturally relevant and relatable to their life experiences or background?**
- I relate the Windows Registry to the administrative department of any place that I've worked.

However, small changes may cause a ripple of things being in disarray if the changes are made without an understanding of the system.

### Questions

1. **How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?**
- These examples of shell scripting may be used in the work place to identify certain scripts and what they are meant to do, identify any errors brought about by a script, and bring another advantage to the workplace.
  
2. **What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time?**
- If I had more time to improve a certain script, I would choose to improve and learn more on all of them. There is a part of me that is interested in the analytical aspect of writing scripts and the meticulous nature of it, therefore, with more free time I would develop all scripts in my ops challenges.
  
3. **What aspect of your shell scripting skillset do you hope to improve next?**
- The aspect of my shell scripting skillset that I hope to improve next would be the ability to take in the instructions given and have a better understanding of what is expected within the script. I would like to understand all of the pieces of the script that come together and gave me the result that I want a little better.

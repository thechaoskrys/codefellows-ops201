# Troubleshooting Techniques

## CompTIA A+ 220-902 Troubleshooting Methodology

### Questions from the assignment
1. *What should you do if multiple issues are happening simultaneously during troubleshooting?*
- If multiple issues are occuring simultaneously during troubleshooting, one must document all things that are occuring. Once identifying the symtoms, it may be easier to look at the sum of all issues and find what the ultimate problem is. 

2. *What should be done once a successful solution has been identified during the troubleshooting process?*
- Once a succesful solution has been identified, it is important to document the solution to the problem in a knowledge base. There should be the creation of a plan to ensure that the solution is able to be implemented, especially in a production based environment where certain things can only be done on certain days. 

3. *What are the benefits of documenting the entire troubleshooting process in a knowledge base?*
- The benefits of documenting the troubleshooting process in a knowledge base is the ability for another person attempting to fix the same issues will be able to gain help from someone else's experience. 

4. *Think about a technological device particularly popular in your culture or community. Imagine a scenario where issues arise: how would you apply CompTIA A+ troubleshooting methodology to help, while considering the end-userâ€™s cultural background?*
- One of the most popular devices I can think of is an iPhone. There may be an multitude of symptoms presented such as being slow, apps closing randomly, the phone being hit, etc. I would follow the flow chart of identifying all of the issues, get a wholistic view of what it could be. I would document all of the possible causes of the issues and resolutions. Once the issue has been resolved, I would be sure to document all steps taken, just in case I were to ever run into a problem like that again (with maybe even my own phone).
